Hiff-hiff? Hiff-hiff?

This project creates hamchat-like words using the existing hamspeak dictionary to identify realtivistic cooccurences of letter combinations inherent to it's unique style of speaking.  Both bigram and trigram counts for character-level counts can be used to adjust the generation of new words.
